# Introduction
Application for Questions-and-Answers online session (Polish version).
The project has been created to facilitate communication between conference guests and conference hosts (or presenters).
The application enables guests to ask their own questions at the end of a conference using the online submission form (preferably on mobile devices).
The hosts use separate website to control and to show the questions they would like to answer.

# How to use
Demo version is available here: (Part I, II, III)
## Part I: https://knsa.pl/
The form which enables guests to ask their own questions.

## Part II: https://knsa.pl/board/
The board which enables hosts to present the chosen questions, e.g. show the selected questions one by one on the projector in the lecture hall.
For better experience, the website can be shown in Fullscreen mode, and the questions can be changed by keyboard arrows
(left arrow for previous question, right arrow for next question)

## Part III: https://knsa.pl/panel/
The admin panel, which is visible to host only. The panel enables hosts to control the behaviour of the application on the spot (preferably on one mobile device).
The most important feature of the panel is the possibility of permanently deleting unwanted (or doubled) questions. The deleted questions will not be shown on the board,
after deleting a question there is no need to refresh the board.

# Background information
The idea of the online Q-and-A session application was developed for the purpose of Students' Academic Circle of English Philology at Catholic University of Lublin, Poland.
One of the Academic Circle's initiatives was to invite middle-school students to the promotion of English Philology and encourage them to study at KUL.
During the event, which took place on April 3rd, 2024, the invited students were able to ask us (Academic Circle representatives) questions about subjects, lecturers, etc.
The application turned out to be useful and was well-received among all participants of the event.
